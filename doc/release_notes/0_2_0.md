### 0.2.0 (9/9/2020)

#### Features

##### SAML Assertion Grant Type

`rodauth-auth` now supports using a SAML Assertion to request for an Access token.In order to enable, you have to:

```ruby
plugin :rodauth do
  enable :oauth_saml
end
```

For more info about integrating it, [check the wiki](https://gitlab.com/os85/rodauth-oauth/-/wikis/SAML-Assertion-Access-Tokens).

##### Supporting rotating keys

At some point, you'll want to replace the pkeys and algorithm used to generate and verify the JWT access tokens, but you want to keep validating previously-distributed JWT tokens, at least until they expire. Now you can, via two new options, `oauth_jwt_legacy_public_key` and `oauth_jwt_legacy_algorithm`, which will be declared in the JWKs URI and used to verify access tokens.


##### Reuse access tokens

If the `oauth_reuse_access_token` is set, if there's already an existing valid access token, any new grant for the same application / account / scope will keep the same access token. This can be helpful in scenarios where one wants the same access token distributed across devices.

##### require_authorizable_account

The method used to verify access to the authorize flow is called `require_authorizable_account`. By default, it checks if a user is logged in by using rodauth's own `require_account`. This is the method you'd want to redefine in order to augment these requirements, i.e. request 2fa authentication.

#### Improvements

Expired and revoked access tokens end up generating a lot of garbage, which will have to be periodically cleaned up. You can mitigate this now by setting a uniqueness index for a group of columns, i.e. if you set a uniqueness index for the `oauth_application_id/account_id/scopes` column, `rodauth-oauth` will transparently reuse the same db entry to store the new access token. If setting some other type of uniqueness index, make sure to update the option `oauth_tokens_unique_columns` (the array of columns from the uniqueness index).

#### Bugfixes

Calling `before_*_route` callbacks appropriately.

Fixed some mishandling of HTTP headers when in in resource-server mode.

#### Chore

* 97.7% test coverage;
* `rodauth-oauth` CI tests run against sqlite, postgresql and mysql.
