### Features

#### Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)

RFC: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126

`rodauth-oauth` supports Pushed Authorization Requests, via the `:oauth_pushed_authorization_request` feature.

More info about the feature [in the wiki](https://gitlab.com/os85/rodauth-oauth/-/wikis/Pushed-Authorization-Requests).

#### mTLS Client Auth (+ certificate-bound access tokens)

RFC: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705

The `:oauth_tls_client_auth` feature adds support for the variants of mTLS Client Authentication "PKI Mutual-TLS Method" and 2Self-Signed Certificate Mutual-TLS Method". It also supports client certificate bound access tokens.

More about it [in the wiki](https://gitlab.com/os85/rodauth-oauth/-/wikis/mTLS-Client-Authentication).

#### Dynamic Client Registration management

RFC: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592

Support for dynamci client registration management was added to the `:oauth_dynamic_client_registration` feature.

More info about it [in the wiki](https://gitlab.com/os85/rodauth-oauth/-/wikis/Dynamic-Client-Registration#getputdelete-registerclient_id).

### Improvements

* Support for 3rd-party initiated login was added, by including support for the `initiate_login_uri` attribute in the register route from the `:oauth_dynamic_client_registration` feature.
* Support for multitenant resource ownership was added, here's a [description from the wiki](https://gitlab.com/os85/rodauth-oauth/-/wikis/How-to#scoping-grants-from-the-same-resource-owner).

### Bugfixes

* oidc: userinfo claims were not including claims with value `false`, such as `"email_verified"`. This behaviour has been fixed, and only claims of value `null` are omitted.
