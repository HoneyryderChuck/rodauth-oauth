### 0.4.1 (24/11/2020)

#### Improvements

When in "Resource Server" mode, calling `rodauth.authorization_token` will now return an hash of the JSON payload that the Authorization Server responds, and which was already previously used to authorize access to protected resources.

#### Bugfixes

* An error occurred if the client passed an empty authorization header (`Authorization: ` or `Authorization: Bearer `), causing an unexpected error; It now responds with the proper `401 Unauthorized` status code.
