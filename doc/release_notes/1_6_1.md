### 1.6.1

#### Bugfixes

Fixed regressions in rails generated templates:

* some `:oauth_dpop` form fields not being rendered;
* `check_box_tag` rails helper usage was wrongly setting all checkboxes to "checked"

#### Chore

* Updated latest features (`:oauth_dpop`) options documentation.
* rails tests will now exercise the rails generated templates again.
