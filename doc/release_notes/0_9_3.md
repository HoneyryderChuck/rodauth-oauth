### 0.9.3 (30/05/2022)

#### Bugfixes

* `oauth_jwt`: new access tokens generated via the `"refresh_token"` grant type are now JWT (it was falling back to non JWT behaviour);
*  `oidc`: a new `id_token` is now generated via the `"refresh_token"` grant type with "rotation" policy (it was being omitted from the response);
* `oidc`: fixing calculation of `"auth_time"` claim, which (as per RFC) needs to stay the same across first authentication and subsequent `"refresh_token"` requests;
    * it requires a new db column (default: `"auth_time"`, datetime) in the `"oauth_tokens"` database;
* hash-column `"refresh_token"` will now expose the refresh token (instead of the hash column version) in the `"refresh_token"` grant type response payload (only happened in "non-rotation" refresh token mode).
