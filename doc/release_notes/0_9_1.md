### 0.9.1 (08/05/2022)

#### Improvements

Using `return_response`, introduced in `rodauth` v2.23, which accomplishes better integration with rails response logging mechanism when used under `rodauth-rails`.

#### Bugfixes

* Fixing namespacing issue which required anyone to have to `require "rodauth-oauth"` before loading it (no need to anymore).
