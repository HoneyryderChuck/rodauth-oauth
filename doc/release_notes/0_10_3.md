### 0.10.2 (29/08/2022)

#### Features

The `oauth_token_subject` rodauth function is introduced. It returns the grant subject (usually the user account id, but in some cases, such as the client credentials grant, returns the oauth application id).

It still has a few rough edges, but in version 1.0, this will be the main function to use to get the associated grant owner from a given token.

#### Bugfixes

* oauth applications management: fixed labels usage in default rails oauth applications list template.
* introspection requests were discarding the `authorization_server_url` url path (only taking the origin). That has been fixed now.
