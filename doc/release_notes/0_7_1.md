### 0.7.1 (05/12/2021)

#### Improvements

* Adapted the `rodauth-i18n` configuration to comply with the guidelines for `v0.2.0` (which is the defacto minimmal supported version).

#### Bugfixes

* `convert_timestamp` was removed from the templates, as it's private API.
* Several missing or wrong URLs in templates fixed (authorize form was wrongly processing scopes when none was selected).
