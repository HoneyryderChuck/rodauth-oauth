# 1.5.0

## Highlights

### OAuth DPoP Support

- **DPoP Feature**: Introducing the `:oauth_dpop` feature that enables the OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) protocol. This provides a mechanism to bind access tokens to a particular client based on public key cryptography.

With this feature, the client demonstrates possession of a cryptographic key by signing the request to the resource server. It helps prevent token theft and replay attacks.

- **Supported JWS Algorithms**: The feature supports various JWS signing algorithms for DPoP headers including `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512`, `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`, and `ES256K`.

- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for DPoP specific errors with the `oauth_invalid_dpop_proof_message` method. It provides a default error message of "Invalid DPoP key binding" but can be customized as per your application's requirements.
